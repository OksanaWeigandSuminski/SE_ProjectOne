	    <h1>WHAT IS CYBERSECURITY?</h1>
	    <p id="first">Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems,
	      networks, and data from malicious attacks. It is also known as information technology security or electronic information security.
	      The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing. A recent Parks Associates survey of more than 10,000
	      U.S. households shows that almost half of consumers describe themselves as "very concerned"
	      about hackers getting control of the connected devices in their homes.<br>Cybercrime has hit the U.S. so hard that every American
				citizen should expect that all of their data (personally identifiable information) has been stolen and is on the dark web.

	    <h1>CYBERSECURITY AT HOME</h1>
	    <p id="second">First, make sure you have a good sense of your vulnerability. How do the products and services you use to automate your
				life collect, manage, and store your data? How do the devices you use potentially share data when you are walking around environments
				that make up the IoT?<br> Next, make sure the passwords for all your devices are unique and include a mix of letters, numbers, and other
				characters that are difficult to guess. Do not share passwords with others. Most importantly, put the proper security tools in place
				to monitor your environment. Early intrusion detection has always been one of best ways to avoid the worst security incidents, and that
				remains true in the age of the IoT.</p>

	    <h1>HOW TO AVOID ATTACKS</h1>
	    <ol id="third">
			<li>Update your software and operating system: This means you benefit from the latest security patches.</li>
			<li>Use anti-virus software. Keep your software updated for the best level of protection.</li>
			<li>Do not open email attachments from unknown senders: These could be infected with malware.</li>
			<li>Do not click on links in emails from unknown senders or unfamiliar websites: This is a common way that malware is spread.</li>
			<li>Avoid using unsecured WiFi networks in public places: Unsecured networks leave you vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
